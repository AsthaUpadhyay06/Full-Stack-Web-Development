    <h2>About The Book</h2>
    <h2>Why <em>Wings of Fire</em> is My Favourite Book</h2>
<p>
    <em>Wings of Fire</em> is my favourite book because it tells the inspiring life story of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, 
    a humble boy who rose to become one of India’s greatest scientists and the President of the country. 
</p>
<p>
    It teaches me that no matter where you come from, with determination and knowledge, you can achieve anything. 
    Dr. Kalam’s journey from Rameswaram to ISRO and DRDO inspires me to work hard for my goals. 
    This book gives me hope and strength whenever I feel lost.
</p>

<h3>Wht I Love It</h3>
 <p>I love this book because it motivates me to dream big and work hard. Dr. Kalam came from a simple background but never
        gave up. His life teaches me that no matter where you come from, with dedication and belief in yourself, you can achieve
        greatness. I feel inspired every time I read it.
